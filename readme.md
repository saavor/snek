# 🐍 snek
a small (and quite bad) python game framework

> NOTE: not done yet

## origins
this project was originally created for writing python *stuff* similar to processing for school stuff. although its not too much like processing now, im gonna try to keep it very similar.

## should i make a game with it?
no, you shouldn't. jokes aside, this is some pretty bad code and not very easy to understand (its fine spaghetti). plus with 0 documentation its gonna be pretty hard.

## is it at all finished?
nope. not even close.

## requirements
as of right now you only need `pygame`.
